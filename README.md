# HotelBookingSystem

This is a Hotel Reservation System. We can store guest data. Details of the reservation.
It is a menu driven program and it runs until the user exits.
We can store guest data. Details of the reservation. We can choose from food ordering, check-out and 4 types of rooms.
Writing of file has been done in a separate thread as it can be done parallely. User defined exception is thrown if the user
tries to book an already allotted room.

#### I used it for the program:
Classes and Objects, Inheritance, File Handling with Objects, ArrayList, implementing
Interface, User defined exception and Exception handling.
